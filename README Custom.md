## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Beginning to piece together responsive layouts and mobile-first workflow. This is my first responsive layout project and my first time attempting a mobie first approach. I learned how to change the visible elements on screen depending on screen size. i.e. 

    .section-one-mobile {
        display: none;
    }

    .section-one-desktop {
        display: block;
    }


### Continued development

I am going to continue to build projects to practice responsive layouts; I would like to incorperate JS into future pojects as well. 

### Useful resources

https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts was very helpful introduction to responsive layouts a a good flexbox overview. I want to continue to practice what I learned in this course to have a solid understanding of how to develop responsive layouts.
